"A project to sandbox Rust, Typescript, Actix-Web, Bun, Svelte"

## Project Status: Preparing (Reading Documentations)

### Technologies

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) a memory safe, RAII based language might be complex
 but that is what I love it so 😍.
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org) as the primary front-end programming
 language. Without this I can't imagine writing JavaScript based project 🧘.
- [Actix-Web](https://actix.rs) the framework for back-end ⚙️.
- [Bun](https://bun.com) the runtime (first class typescript support so :>) 🏃.
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) just really light with minimal runtime overhead
 and I love it 👨‍🚀.
